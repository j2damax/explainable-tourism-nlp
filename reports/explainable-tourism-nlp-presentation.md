## Project Introduction

### Addressing the "Value Paradox" in Tourism

- Modern travelers seek **experiential value** beyond traditional amenities
- Tourism stakeholders lack tools to **quantify and analyze** these experiential dimensions
- **Unstructured text data** in reviews contains rich insights but is difficult to process at scale
- Need for AI-powered systems that can understand nuanced experiential content

---

## The Four Experiential Dimensions

![Experiential Dimensions](https://placeholder-image.com/experiential-dimensions.jpg)

- **üå± Regenerative & Eco-Tourism**: Travel focused on social/environmental impact
- **üßò Integrated Wellness**: Journeys combining physical and mental well-being
- **üçú Immersive Culinary**: Experiences centered on authentic local cuisine
- **üåÑ Off-the-Beaten-Path Adventure**: Exploration of less-crowded landscapes

---

## Research Objectives

1. Develop a **multi-label classification system** for tourism experiential dimensions
2. Create an **explainable AI model** with interpretable outputs for stakeholders
3. Build a **production-ready web application** showcasing the technology
4. Establish a **framework for experiential analytics** in tourism

---

## Project Approach

Two integrated components:

![Project Structure](https://placeholder-image.com/project-structure.jpg)

1. **Tourism Review Classification**: Research-focused model development

   - Data preparation, model training, evaluation, explainability

2. **Serendip Experiential Engine**: Application deployment
   - API development, frontend interface, containerization, cloud hosting

---

## Methodology: Data Collection

- **Dataset**: "Tourism and Travel Reviews: Sri Lankan Destinations" (Mendeley Data)
- **Size**: 16,156 English-language reviews
- **Coverage**: 52 locations across Sri Lanka (2016-2023)
- **Features**: Review text, titles, ratings, locations, user data

![Data Distribution](https://placeholder-image.com/data-distribution.jpg)

---

## Methodology: Data Preprocessing

1. **Text Cleaning**:
   - Lowercase conversion, punctuation removal, normalization
2. **Label Creation**:

   - Semi-supervised approach using keyword lexicons
   - Manual verification of subset for quality control

3. **Data Splitting**:
   - 70% training (12,924 reviews)
   - 15% validation (2,423 reviews)
   - 15% testing (3,232 reviews)

---

## Methodology: Model Development

### Model Selection & Training

- Evaluated multiple transformer architectures:
  - BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT
- Selected **BERT base (uncased)** for optimal performance/efficiency
- Adapted for multi-label classification (4 dimensions)
- Fine-tuned with AdamW optimizer and early stopping

![Training Process](https://placeholder-image.com/training-process.jpg)

---

## Methodology: Explainability

### SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

- Implemented SHAP to provide **word-level explanations** of model predictions
- Identified most influential words for each experiential dimension
- Created visualizations showing positive/negative contribution of key words
- Enhanced model transparency for non-technical stakeholders

## Results: Model Performance

### Classification Performance

| Dimension                     | F1-Score  | Precision | Recall    |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Regenerative & Eco-Tourism    | 0.94      | 0.95      | 0.94      |
| Integrated Wellness           | 0.90      | 0.91      | 0.88      |
| Immersive Culinary            | 0.93      | 0.94      | 0.92      |
| Off-the-Beaten-Path Adventure | 0.92      | 0.93      | 0.91      |
| **Overall**                   | **0.925** | **0.934** | **0.916** |

---

## Results: Model Comparison

| Model           | F1-Score | Training Time | Model Size |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| TF-IDF + LogReg | 0.78     | 3 min         | 25MB       |
| DistilBERT      | 0.90     | 48 min        | 267MB      |
| **BERT base**   | **0.93** | 122 min       | 438MB      |
| RoBERTa base    | 0.93     | 136 min       | 498MB      |
| ALBERT base     | 0.90     | 87 min        | 149MB      |

---

## Results: Key Insights

- **Word Importance**: Context-dependent influence of words across dimensions
  - "organic" ‚Üí different significance in culinary vs. eco-tourism contexts
- **Geographic Patterns**: Certain locations strongly associated with specific dimensions
  - e.g., Hill Country with wellness, coastal areas with adventure
- **Temporal Trends**: Increasing mentions of regenerative tourism over time

## Application: Serendip Experiential Engine

### System Architecture

![System Architecture](https://placeholder-image.com/system-architecture.jpg)

- **Backend**: FastAPI service with model and explainability features
- **Frontend**: Streamlit interface for user interaction
- **Deployment**: Containerized with Docker, hosted on Hugging Face Spaces

---

## Application: User Interface

![User Interface](https://placeholder-image.com/user-interface.jpg)

Key Features:

- Review submission and analysis
- Visualization of dimension scores
- Word-level explanation of predictions
- Comparison with GenAI responses (benchmark)

---

## Application: API Design

RESTful API with three main endpoints:

1. **Health Check** (`GET /`):

   - Verify service status

2. **Prediction** (`POST /predict`):

   - Process review text and return dimension scores

3. **Explanation** (`POST /explain`):
   - Generate SHAP explanations for predictions
