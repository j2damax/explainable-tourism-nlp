## 1. Introduction and Research Context

### 1.1 Research Problem

Tourism reviews contain rich, unstructured data about visitor experiences that is difficult to quantify and analyze at scale. This research addresses the "Value Paradox" in Sri Lankan tourism, where there is a significant gap between the experiential value tourists seek and what is measured or understood by traditional tourism metrics and analysis methods.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

1. Develop a multi-label classification system capable of identifying four key experiential dimensions in tourism reviews
2. Demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models for understanding nuanced travel experiences
3. Create explainable AI outputs that provide actionable insights for tourism stakeholders
4. Establish a foundation for more sophisticated tourism analytics and personalization systems

### 1.3 Theoretical Framework

The research builds on:

- **Multi-label text classification**: Extends traditional text classification to allow for multiple, non-exclusive labels
- **Transfer learning in NLP**: Uses pre-trained language models fine-tuned for domain-specific tasks
- **Explainable AI**: Prioritizes transparency in model decisions for tourism industry stakeholders
- **Experiential dimensions in tourism**: Draws from literature on experience economy and modern travel motivations

## 2. Data Collection and Preparation

### 2.1 Dataset Source

The primary dataset used for this research is the "Tourism and Travel Reviews: Sri Lankan Destinations" corpus from Mendeley Data, containing 16,156 English-language reviews of Sri Lankan destinations. This dataset was selected for its comprehensiveness, recency, and relevance to the research objectives.

## 4. Feature Engineering

### 4.1 Text Representation

The research explored multiple approaches to represent text for the classification model:

1. **Bag-of-words and TF-IDF**: Initial baseline approaches
2. **Word embeddings**: Explored Word2Vec and GloVe for contextual representation
3. **Transformer tokenization**: Selected approach using model-specific tokenizers

The final approach used the AutoTokenizer from Hugging Face's transformers library to convert text into token IDs compatible with the selected pre-trained models.

### 4.2 Feature Selection

Features were carefully selected and engineered:

- Review text: Primary input for classification
- Review title: Used as supplementary information
- Metadata features: Excluded to focus on text-based classification

### 4.3 Data Augmentation

Limited data augmentation techniques were applied:

- Random masking: Occasional replacement of tokens with [MASK]
- Synonym replacement: For less-represented experiential dimensions
- Back-translation: English → another language → English (limited use)

### 4.4 Data Format

Data was formatted for PyTorch-based training:

```python
class ReviewsDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, encodings, labels):
        self.encodings = encodings
        self.labels = torch.tensor(labels, dtype=torch.float32)
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        item = {key: val[idx] for key, val in self.encodings.items()
        item['labels'] = self.labels[idx]
        return item
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.labels)
```

## 5. Model Architecture and Training

### 5.1 Model Selection

After extensive experimentation, the following transformer models were evaluated:

1. BERT base (uncased)
2. DistilBERT
3. RoBERTa
4. ALBERT

BERT base (uncased) was selected as the primary model due to its balance of performance and efficiency. The model architecture was adapted for multi-label classification by modifying the output layer to produce independent probabilities for each label.

### 5.2 Hyperparameter Optimization

A systematic approach to hyperparameter tuning was implemented:

| Parameter     | Values Tested | Final Value             |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Learning Rate | 1e-5 to 5e-4  | 2e-5                    |
| Batch Size    | 8, 16, 32     | 16                      |
| Epochs        | 2-10          | 4 (with early stopping) |
| Weight Decay  | 0.01, 0.001   | 0.01                    |
| Dropout       | 0.1-0.5       | 0.3                     |

Grid search and early stopping were used to identify optimal hyperparameters, with model performance tracked using MLflow.

### 5.3 Training Process

The training process followed a systematic approach:

1. Model initialization with pre-trained weights
2. Adaptation of classifier head for multi-label output
3. Fine-tuning with AdamW optimizer and linear learning rate scheduler
4. Implementation of early stopping based on validation F1-score
5. Logging of training metrics and model checkpoints

```python
# Model initialization code (excerpt)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    num_labels=4,
    problem_type="multi_label_classification"
)

# Training loop (excerpt)
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    model.train()
    train_loss = 0
    for batch in train_dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        inputs = {k: v.to(device) for k, v in batch.items() if k != 'labels'}
        labels = batch['labels'].to(device)
        outputs = model(**inputs, labels=labels)
        loss = outputs.loss
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        scheduler.step()
        train_loss += loss.item()
```

### 5.4 Computational Resources

## 7. Model Explainability

### 7.1 SHAP Implementation

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was implemented to provide transparency into model predictions:

```python
# SHAP implementation (excerpt)
class ShapExplainer:
    def __init__(self, model, tokenizer):
        self.model = model
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer
        self.device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

    def explain_text(self, text, top_n_words=10):
        """Generate SHAP explanations for a given text"""
        # Tokenize input
        inputs = self.tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True)
        inputs = {k: v.to(self.device) for k, v in inputs.items()}

        # Create explainer
        explainer = shap.Explainer(self.predict_fn, self.tokenizer)

        # Generate explanations
        shap_values = explainer(text)

        # Process results
        word_explanations = self._process_shap_values(shap_values, text, top_n_words)

        return word_explanations
```

### 7.2 Feature Importance

SHAP analysis revealed key patterns in feature importance:

- Most influential words for Regenerative & Eco-Tourism: "sustainable," "eco-friendly," "conservation"
- Most influential words for Integrated Wellness: "yoga," "ayurveda," "relaxation"
- Most influential words for Immersive Culinary: "spices," "authentic," "local food"
- Most influential words for Off-the-Beaten-Path Adventure: "hiking," "wilderness," "off-road"
