This repository contains two related projects focused on tourism experience analysis and classification:

## 1. Tourism Review Classification

Located in the `tourism-review-classification` directory, this is the original research project that developed an explainable NLP model for classifying experiential dimensions in Sri Lankan tourist reviews.

This project includes:

- Data analysis and preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization and explainability components
- Research notebooks and documentation

[View Tourism Review Classification Project](./tourism-review-classification/README.md)

### Environment Setup

Copy the `.env.example` file in the tourism-review-classification directory to `.env` and add your credentials:

```bash
cd tourism-review-classification
cp .env.example .env
# Edit the .env file with your credentials
```

## 2. Serendip Experiential Engine

Located in the `serendip-experiential-engine` directory, this is the web application that implements the tourism classification model with a user-friendly interface.

### Live Demo

The application is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces:

- [Frontend Application](https://huggingface.co/spaces/j2damax/serendip-experiential-frontend)
- [Backend API](https://huggingface.co/spaces/j2damax/serendip-experiential-backend)

### Experiential Dimensions

The application analyzes tourism reviews across four key experiential dimensions:

- 🌱 **Regenerative & Eco-Tourism**: Travel focused on positive social/environmental impact
- 🧘 **Integrated Wellness**: Journeys combining physical and mental well-being
- 🍜 **Immersive Culinary**: Experiences centered on authentic local cuisine
- 🌄 **Off-the-Beaten-Path Adventure**: Exploration of less-crowded natural landscapes

### Running Locally

The application can be run locally using Docker Compose:

```bash
cd serendip-experiential-engine
docker-compose up
```

### Deploying to Hugging Face Spaces

Deployment scripts are provided for both frontend and backend services:

```bash
# Deploy backend
cd serendip-experiential-engine/backend
export HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
./deploy_to_huggingface.sh

# Deploy frontend
cd serendip-experiential-engine/frontend
export HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
./deploy_to_huggingface.sh
```

## 2. Serendip Experiential Engine

Located in the `serendip-experiential-engine` directory, this is the production-ready web application that implements the tourism review classification model in a user-friendly interface.

This project includes:

- FastAPI backend for serving the classification model
- Streamlit frontend for interactive visualization
- Docker containerization for easy deployment
- Explainability features using SHAP

### Environment Setup

The application is already configured with its own `.env` file in the serendip-experiential-engine directory:

```bash
cd serendip-experiential-engine
# The .env file already exists, you can modify it as needed
```

### Online Demo

The application is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces:

- Frontend: [https://huggingface.co/spaces/j2damax/serendip-experiential-frontend](https://huggingface.co/spaces/j2damax/serendip-experiential-frontend)
- Backend: [https://huggingface.co/spaces/j2damax/serendip-experiential-backend](https://huggingface.co/spaces/j2damax/serendip-experiential-backend)

## Getting Started

### Tourism Review Classification

Follow the setup instructions in the [Tourism Review Classification README](./tourism-review-classification/README.md).

### Serendip Experiential Engine

1. Navigate to the web application directory:

```bash
cd serendip-experiential-engine
```

2. Start the application using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

3. Access the frontend at http://localhost:8501

# Create virtual environment

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify installation

python verify_installation.py

````

### Running the EDA

```bash
# Start Jupyter Lab
jupyter lab

# Open tourism_data_cleaning_and_entity_linking.ipynb
# Run all cells to perform exploratory data analysis
````

### Running the Web Application

```bash
# Start the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
```

## Dataset

The project uses the "Tourism and Travel Reviews: Sri Lankan Destinations" dataset from Mendeley Data, containing 16,156 English-language reviews of Sri Lankan destinations.

**Dataset Features:**

- Review text and titles
- Location information (cities, types)
- User demographics and ratings
- Temporal data
