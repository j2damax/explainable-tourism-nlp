A Technical Blueprint for the Aria-Core-ANN Project: From Foundational Architecture to Portfolio Showcase


Part 1: Strategic Foundation: Architecting a Portfolio-Grade Project

The initial phase of any advanced machine learning project is dedicated to establishing a professional engineering framework. This is not merely a preliminary step but a foundational requirement that ensures reproducibility, scalability, and collaboration. For a project intended to serve as a career-defining portfolio piece, demonstrating an MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) mindset from the outset is paramount. This section outlines the strategic and architectural bedrock upon which the Aria-Core-ANN system will be constructed.

1.1 The Why: Framing the Business Problem

The core objective of this project transcends a simple academic exercise in text classification. It is designed to provide a tangible solution to a well-defined business challenge within the Sri Lankan tourism sector: the "Value Paradox".1 This paradox describes the modern European traveler who, while conscious of cost, prioritizes the authenticity, uniqueness, and transformative potential of an experience over the lowest absolute price.1 Traditional tourism platforms, with their generic categorical filters, fail to cater to this nuanced demand.
The proposed solution is the "Aria-Core-ANN," which will function as the "Experiential Engine" for the broader Aria concept.1 Its specific task is to analyze unstructured tourist reviews and quantify abstract, high-value experiential dimensions. These dimensions, derived directly from the analysis of modern traveler motivations, are: 'Regenerative & Eco-Tourism', 'Integrated Wellness', 'Immersive Culinary', and 'Off-the-Beaten-Path Adventure'.1 By building this engine, the project directly addresses a critical gap in the market, transforming qualitative user sentiment into a structured, machine-readable format that can power a new generation of intelligent travel recommendation systems.

1.2 Blueprint for Excellence: Project Structure and MLOps Best Practices

A key differentiator between an academic exercise and a professional-grade machine learning project lies in its structure and adherence to engineering best practices. A hiring manager or technical lead reviewing a project on GitHub makes an initial assessment in seconds, often based on the project's organization before ever reading a line of code. A clean, standardized structure and rigorous versioning act as a "silent interview," immediately communicating a candidate's understanding of reproducibility, collaboration, and the end-to-end ML lifecycle. Therefore, meticulous setup is a direct investment in the project's value as a portfolio piece.
Directory Structure
To ensure clarity and maintainability, the project will adopt a standardized, modular structure based on the widely accepted cookiecutter-data-science template.2 This approach is a hallmark of a "future-proof" machine learning project, as it enforces a logical separation of concerns.4 The directory will include distinct folders for raw data (
data/raw), processed data (data/processed), Jupyter notebooks for exploration (notebooks), modular source code (src), trained models (models), and final reports (reports).
Version Control
A robust version control strategy is non-negotiable for ensuring project integrity and reproducibility.
Code Versioning: All source code, notebooks, and configuration files will be versioned using Git. A comprehensive .gitignore file will be configured to prevent the tracking of large data files, compiled artifacts, and environment secrets, which is a critical security and repository management practice.5
Data and Model Versioning: To manage large data and model files that are unsuitable for a Git repository, the project will implement Data Version Control (DVC).6 DVC works in tandem with Git, using small metafiles to track versions of large assets stored in a remote location (e.g., cloud storage). This enables the perfect, byte-for-byte reproduction of any experiment, a cornerstone of professional MLOps.
Environment Management
To guarantee that the project can be reliably executed by any user on any machine, all Python dependencies will be explicitly defined in a requirements.txt file.1 This file captures the exact versions of all libraries used, eliminating environment-related errors and ensuring seamless reproducibility.
The following table outlines the selected technology stack, providing a clear rationale for each choice and demonstrating a deliberate, well-considered architectural design process.

Part 2: The Experiential Engine: A Deep Dive into Multi-Label Text Classification

This section details the technical implementation of the core neural network classifier, forming the central component of the NIB 7088 coursework. The focus is on a rigorous, justified, and state-of-the-art approach to multi-label text classification.

2.1 Data Foundation: Acquisition, EDA, and Preprocessing

The foundation of any successful machine learning model is a well-understood and meticulously prepared dataset.
Dataset: The primary data source will be the "Tourism and Travel Reviews: Sri Lankan Destinations" dataset available on Mendeley Data, as specified in the coursework project plan.1 This corpus provides a rich collection of authentic, English-language reviews necessary for the task.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Before any modeling, a comprehensive EDA will be conducted to satisfy the requirements of Question 1 in the assessment rubric.1 This analysis will include visualizing the distribution of review lengths and star ratings, and employing word clouds and n-gram analysis to identify the most frequent terms and phrases. This initial exploration provides crucial insights into the data's structure and potential challenges.
Labeling Strategy: The task is defined as multi-label classification, where a single review can be assigned multiple experiential labels simultaneously.21 A semi-supervised labeling strategy will be employed for the four defined dimensions. Initial labels will be programmatically assigned using a curated lexicon of keywords and phrases relevant to each dimension (e.g., "community," "eco-lodge" for Regenerative & Eco-Tourism). A subset of these programmatically labeled reviews will then be manually verified to ensure high-quality ground truth for model training.1

2.2 The Case for Transformers: A Justified Architectural Choice

A core requirement of the coursework (Question 2) is to justify the selection of the model architecture.1 The choice of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), specifically a transformer-based model, is not arbitrary but a necessity driven by the complexity of the task.
Limitations of Classical ML: Traditional machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) using TF-IDF vectors, are fundamentally inadequate for this problem.1 These methods operate on a "bag-of-words" principle, treating words as independent features and failing to capture the semantic context and word order that give language its meaning.24 For instance, a classical model cannot discern the profound difference in meaning between "a peaceful retreat" and "a retreat from peace."
The Power of Self-Attention: Transformer architectures, first introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need," represent a paradigm shift in processing sequential data.25 Their core innovation is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of every word in a sentence relative to every other word. This enables the model to build a rich, context-aware representation of the text and capture the long-range, global semantic relationships necessary to identify abstract concepts like "regenerative tourism".11 This inherent ability to understand context makes transformers the ideal and necessary choice for this nuanced classification problem.

2.3 Implementation Guide: Fine-Tuning with Hugging Face

The implementation will leverage the Hugging Face ecosystem, which provides the tools for efficient and state-of-the-art model fine-tuning.
Model Selection: A pre-trained transformer model such as DistilBERT or RoBERTa will be used.1 These models offer a compelling balance of high performance and computational efficiency, making them well-suited for a project with a 15-day timeline. They are significantly smaller and faster to train than larger counterparts like BERT-base while retaining the majority of their performance.10
Preprocessing: The corresponding AutoTokenizer for the chosen model will be used to convert the raw review text into a sequence of token IDs. This process will include truncating texts to the model's maximum input length and applying padding to ensure all sequences in a batch are of uniform length.10
Multi-Label Configuration: Correctly configuring the model for a multi-label task is critical. This involves three key adjustments:
When loading the pre-trained model using AutoModelForSequenceClassification, the problem_type parameter will be explicitly set to "multi_label_classification".23
The final layer of the network will use a Sigmoid activation function. Unlike Softmax, which forces probabilities to sum to one (suitable for single-label, multi-class problems), Sigmoid outputs an independent probability between 0 and 1 for each label.27
The loss function will be set to BinaryCrossEntropyWithLogitsLoss. This is the standard and most appropriate loss function for multi-label classification problems where each label is treated as an independent binary classification task.22
Training and Evaluation: The high-level Hugging Face Trainer API will be used to manage the fine-tuning process.9 This API abstracts away the complexities of the training loop, such as moving data to the GPU and performing periodic evaluations.
TrainingArguments will be defined to specify key hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and the number of training epochs.1 Given that standard accuracy is a misleading metric for multi-label tasks, performance will be evaluated using more appropriate measures, namely label-wise F1-score and Hamming Loss, as specified in the coursework plan.1
While the standard BinaryCrossEntropyWithLogitsLoss is a robust and effective choice, it operates under the assumption that labels are independent.21 Recent research has explored more advanced techniques, such as contrastive learning, which can better capture the complex relationships and co-occurrences between labels. However, these studies also indicate that the performance advantage of such methods is most significant in datasets with a large number of labels.21 Given the project's scope with four labels and a tight 15-day deadline, implementing a custom contrastive loss function would introduce considerable complexity and risk. Therefore, the pragmatic and strategically sound approach is to use the standard, well-supported loss function. A discussion of these advanced methods can be included in the final report's "Future Work" section to demonstrate a deeper academic awareness of the state-of-the-art.

Part 3: Building Trust and Transparency: Implementing Explainable AI

This section addresses the critical Explainable AI (XAI) requirement (Question 5) of the coursework, which is not just an academic checkbox but a vital component for building user trust in the final Aria system.1 An opaque recommendation from an AI is unlikely to be trusted, especially for high-value decisions like travel planning.

3.1 The Theory of Interpretability: SHAP vs. LIME

To fulfill the coursework's requirement for a comparative analysis of XAI methodologies, the project will evaluate the two leading post-hoc explanation frameworks.
LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations): LIME functions by creating local surrogate models. It generates perturbations of a specific input instance and trains a simple, interpretable model (like linear regression) to approximate the behavior of the complex "black-box" model in that local vicinity.30 While LIME is fast and intuitive, its primary weakness is a lack of stability; due to the random nature of the perturbation process, explanations for the same instance can vary between runs.12
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations): SHAP is grounded in cooperative game theory and calculates Shapley values to determine the marginal contribution of each feature to a specific prediction.13 This approach comes with strong theoretical guarantees, such as efficiency (the explanations sum up to the final prediction) and consistency. This mathematical rigor makes SHAP more stable and robust than LIME, establishing it as the preferred choice for a project where trustworthiness and reliability are paramount.12
Integrated Gradients (IG): As a gradient-based method, IG is well-suited for explaining differentiable models like neural networks.35 While powerful, the
shap library's Explainer provides a more unified and user-friendly interface for explaining entire Hugging Face pipeline objects, simplifying implementation.35
The following table provides a systematic justification for selecting SHAP, demonstrating the informed technical decision-making process required by the coursework.

Criterion
LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
Rationale for Selection
Methodology
Local surrogate models (approximates the black-box model locally).
Game-theoretic Shapley values (calculates exact feature contributions).
SHAP's foundation in game theory provides stronger theoretical guarantees.
Consistency
Can be unstable; results may vary between runs due to random sampling of perturbations.12
Consistent and stable; the same input will always produce the same explanation.12
Consistency is crucial for a trustworthy portfolio piece.
Output
Provides local, per-prediction explanations.
Provides both local explanations and can be aggregated for global feature importance.12
SHAP offers greater flexibility for both debugging and overall model understanding.
Computational Cost
Generally faster as it uses a local approximation.35
Can be computationally expensive, especially KernelSHAP.35 However, optimized explainers exist for tree models and transformers.
For a single-model coursework project, SHAP's cost is manageable and justified by its robustness.
Selection


Selected
SHAP's theoretical soundness, consistency, and rich visualizations make it the superior choice for a high-quality academic and portfolio project.


3.2 Practical Implementation of SHAP for Transformers

The implementation will focus on creating intuitive, visual explanations that make the model's decision-making process transparent to the end-user.
Integration: The shap library integrates seamlessly with the Hugging Face ecosystem. A transformers.pipeline object, which encapsulates the fine-tuned model and its tokenizer, can be passed directly to a shap.Explainer.34
Explanation Generation: For any given tourist review, the explainer will compute SHAP values for each token. These values represent how much each word or phrase contributed to pushing the model's output probability higher (a positive contribution) or lower (a negative contribution) for each of the four experiential labels.
Visualization: The power of SHAP lies in its visualization capabilities, which will be integrated directly into the final web application:
Text/Force Plots: These plots display the input text and use color to highlight the influence of each word on a specific prediction. Words pushing the prediction higher are typically colored red, while those pushing it lower are colored blue.13 This provides the granular, per-prediction explanation required by the coursework and is essential for building user trust.1
Summary/Beeswarm Plots: While text plots explain a single prediction, summary plots aggregate SHAP values across many samples to provide a global view of which features (in this case, words) are most important to the model overall.13

Part 4: The Generative AI Benchmark: A Comparative Analysis

This section directly addresses Question 6 of the coursework, which mandates a rigorous comparison between the developed ANN and a state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) model.1 This analysis is crucial for understanding the practical trade-offs between specialized, fine-tuned models and large, general-purpose language models (LLMs).

4.1 Few-Shot Learning with LLMs for Classification

Instead of fine-tuning a massive LLM, which is computationally prohibitive, the project will utilize a more agile and cost-effective technique known as "few-shot prompting".19
Technique: A powerful, pre-trained LLM such as GPT-4 will be accessed via its API.20 Few-shot learning involves conditioning the model by providing it with a small number of examples of the task directly within the prompt itself.41 The model then uses these examples as a template to perform the classification on a new, unseen instance.
Prompt Engineering: The success of this approach hinges on careful prompt engineering. A structured prompt will be designed that clearly outlines the classification task, defines the four possible experiential labels, provides 2-3 high-quality examples of reviews with their correct multi-label classifications (the "shots"), and finally presents the target review to be classified.1

4.2 A Rigorous Head-to-Head Comparison

To provide a comprehensive analysis, both the fine-tuned DistilBERT model and the few-shot GPT-4 approach will be evaluated on the same held-out test set. The comparison will extend beyond simple performance metrics to include critical real-world factors such as cost, control, and data privacy, as required by the coursework.1
The following matrix provides a clear, data-driven comparison that will form the core of the GenAI analysis in the final report. This demonstrates a practical understanding of the trade-offs involved in real-world AI system design.

Metric
Fine-Tuned DistilBERT (Aria-Core-ANN)
Few-Shot GPT-4 (GenAI Approach)
Analysis & Conclusion
Performance (F1-Score)
To be measured on the test set. Expected to be high due to task-specific training.
To be measured on the test set. Performance is high but may be less consistent without specific tuning.44
The fine-tuned model is expected to outperform the general-purpose LLM on this highly specific task.45
Development Cost & Time
Higher upfront effort: requires data labeling, training pipeline, and hyperparameter tuning.45
Lower upfront effort: relies on prompt engineering, enabling rapid prototyping.1
LLM is faster for initial PoC, but fine-tuning provides a more robust, long-term asset.
Inference Cost (per 1k reviews)
Very low. Once deployed on owned hardware (e.g., Hugging Face Spaces CPU), the cost is negligible.
High and variable. Based on API pricing per token.46
The fine-tuned model is vastly more cost-effective at scale. This is a critical business consideration.
Controllability & Reproducibility
High. The model is a fixed artifact. The training process is fully reproducible with versioned data and code (DVC).
Lower. Performance is sensitive to prompt phrasing. Model updates by the API provider can change behavior ("model drift").1
The fine-tuned model offers superior control and reliability, which is essential for enterprise applications.
Data Privacy
High. Data remains within your controlled environment during training and inference.45
Lower. Data must be sent to a third-party API, which can be a concern for sensitive information.45
For enterprise use cases with proprietary data, the fine-tuned approach is often the only viable option.


Part 5: From Model to Application: Deployment and User Interaction

This phase transitions the project from a set of code and models into a tangible, interactive application. This fulfills the deployment (Question 4) and demonstration requirements of the coursework and is a critical step in creating a compelling portfolio piece.1

5.1 Building the Interactive Classifier with Streamlit

The choice of framework for building the user interface is critical for a project with a rapid development cycle.
Framework Choice: Streamlit is the ideal choice for this project. It is an open-source Python library designed specifically for data scientists and machine learning engineers to build and share data applications with minimal code and no front-end web development experience.14 Its simplicity and speed are perfectly aligned with the project's 15-day timeline.
UI Components: The web application will be designed for clarity and user-friendliness, featuring several key Streamlit widgets:
A title and descriptive text using st.title() and st.markdown().
A text input box (st.text_area) for the user to paste or type a tourist review.1
An action button (st.button) to trigger the classification process.
A clear visualization of the model's multi-label predictions, likely using st.bar_chart to show the confidence score for each of the four experiential dimensions.
An interactive section dedicated to the SHAP explanation. The streamlit-shap component will be used to render SHAP's rich, interactive HTML plots directly within the Streamlit application, providing a seamless user experience.14

5.2 Deployment to Hugging Face Spaces

A model is only truly complete when it is accessible. Deploying the application to a public platform is a crucial final step.
Platform: Hugging Face Spaces is the premier platform for hosting and sharing machine learning demo applications. It integrates perfectly with the broader Hugging Face ecosystem, automates the deployment process, and offers a generous free tier for community projects.8
Process: The deployment process is remarkably straightforward:
A new "Space" is created on the Hugging Face Hub, with the SDK (Software Development Kit) specified as "Streamlit".
The project's Git repository, which contains the main app.py script and the requirements.txt file, is linked to the Space.
When code is pushed to the repository, Hugging Face Spaces automatically initiates a build process. It reads the requirements.txt file, installs all the necessary dependencies in a container, and launches the Streamlit application.8
This act of deployment is a powerful skill demonstrator. Many academic data science projects conclude within the confines of a Jupyter Notebook. By taking the final step to build and deploy a live, interactive web application, the project showcases an understanding of the entire end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. This is a key differentiator that elevates the project from a mere analysis to a functional product, a capability highly valued in ML Engineer roles and a direct contributor to the user's career transition goals.

Part 6: The Career Accelerator: Showcasing Your Work for Maximum Impact

The final phase of the project is dedicated to packaging and presenting the work to a professional audience. A technically brilliant project has limited career impact if it is not communicated effectively. This multi-platform strategy is designed to maximize visibility and demonstrate a wide range of skills beyond just coding.

6.1 The GitHub Showcase: Your Professional Calling Card

The GitHub repository is the technical foundation of the portfolio. Its README.md file is the single most important piece of documentation and should be treated as a comprehensive project report.58 A well-structured README serves as a guide for technical reviewers and hiring managers, allowing them to quickly grasp the project's scope, methodology, and results. The README will be structured to include:
Project Title and High-Level Description: A concise summary of the project.
Business Problem: A clear articulation of the "Why" from Part 1, framing the project in a commercial context.
Technical Architecture: A diagram and description of the end-to-end pipeline, from data ingestion to deployment.

Key Results: A summary of the model's performance metrics and the key findings from the comparative analysis with the GenAI approach.
Live Demo: A prominent link to the deployed application on Hugging Face Spaces, allowing reviewers to interact with the final product immediately.

6.2 The Medium Technical Deep-Dive: Storytelling with Data

A technical blog post on a platform like Medium serves to demonstrate crucial communication skills—the ability to explain complex topics to a broader audience.59 The article will be crafted as a narrative, telling the story of the project from conception to completion.60 It will begin with the compelling business problem of regenerative travel in Sri Lanka, walk the reader through the technical challenges encountered (e.g., the need for multi-label classification, the importance of explainability), present the implemented solution, and conclude with the insights gained. The post will be enriched with code snippets, key EDA visualizations, and screenshots of the final Streamlit application to make the content accessible and engaging.

6.3 The LinkedIn Professional Summary: Driving Engagement

LinkedIn is the primary channel for professional networking and visibility to recruiters.63 A post summarizing the project should be concise, impactful, and designed to capture attention in a busy feed. The post will be structured as follows:
The Hook: An engaging question or statement about the intersection of AI, travel, and cultural understanding.
The Problem: A brief, one-sentence summary of the challenge the project addresses.
The Solution: An introduction to the "Aria-Core-ANN" project, highlighting its key features (transformer model, SHAP explainability) and its purpose.
The Call to Action: Clear links to the three core assets: the live demo on Hugging Face Spaces, the detailed blog post on Medium, and the full codebase on GitHub.
Strategic Hashtags: A selection of relevant hashtags (e.g., #MachineLearning, #AI, #NLP, #Portfolio, #DataScience, #ExplainableAI, #MLOps) to increase the post's reach.
This strategic, multi-platform communication plan ensures that the project's value is conveyed effectively to different audiences, from deeply technical hiring managers to recruiters and the broader tech community.

Coursework Project Plan: NIB 7088 Artificial Neural Network
Project Title: Aria-Core-ANN: An Explainable Neural Network for Classifying Experiential Dimensions in Sri Lankan Tourist Reviews
1. Project Background & Problem Statement
This project serves as the foundational "Experiential Engine" for a larger MSc research concept named "Aria," an AI system designed to generate hyper-personalized, regenerative travel itineraries for Sri Lanka.
The Core Problem: The modern, high-value European traveler to Sri Lanka is driven by a "Value Paradox"; they are cost-conscious but prioritize the quality and authenticity of their experience above all else. They seek journeys that align with specific, nuanced themes like regenerative tourism, wellness, culinary immersion, and authentic adventure. Traditional tourism platforms, which filter by generic categories like "beach" or "heritage site," are inadequate for meeting these complex, multi-faceted demands.  
The ANN Solution: To power the "Aria" system, a core component is needed that can understand and quantify these abstract experiential dimensions from unstructured data. This project will develop a specialized Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to analyze the text of tourist reviews and classify tourism entities (hotels, attractions, etc.) along these key dimensions. This directly addresses the "Enterprise AI" application area outlined in the coursework, specifically by creating a solution that enhances the customer relationship management and product personalization capabilities of the tourism industry.  
2. Detailed Plan by Coursework Assessment Criteria
This plan is structured to directly address each question in the NIB 7088 assessment rubric.  
Question 1: Datasets and EDA (10 marks)
Dataset Collection: The primary dataset will be the "Tourism and Travel Reviews: Sri Lankan Destinations" corpus available on Mendeley Data. This dataset, published in 2023, contains a comprehensive collection of English-language reviews for diverse Sri Lankan destinations, making it ideal for this task.  
Dataset Preparation:
Data Cleaning: Standard text preprocessing will be applied, including converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, URLs, and numerical digits.
Labeling: A semi-supervised labeling strategy will be employed. Guided by the framework in the main research proposal, a lexicon of keywords and phrases will be developed for each of the four key experiential dimensions (see table below). This lexicon will be used to programmatically assign initial multi-label classifications to the reviews, which will then be manually verified on a subset to ensure quality.  
Splitting: The dataset will be split into training (70%), validation (15%), and testing (15%) sets.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A comprehensive EDA will be conducted, including:
Distribution of review ratings (1-5 stars).
Analysis of review length (word count distribution).
Word frequency analysis and word clouds to identify the most common terms.
N-gram analysis to discover common phrases associated with high and low ratings.
Table: Experiential Dimensions for Multi-Label Classification

Question 2: Solution Design (20 marks)
ANN Architecture Design: The proposed solution is a multi-label text classification model based on a fine-tuned transformer architecture.
Model: We will use a pre-trained transformer model such as DistilBERT or RoBERTa from the Hugging Face library.
Architecture: The pre-trained transformer base will be followed by a dropout layer for regularization and a final dense layer with a sigmoid activation function. The sigmoid function is chosen because it outputs a probability between 0 and 1 for each of the four independent experiential dimensions, making it ideal for multi-label classification.
Justification of Approach:
Why an ANN is Necessary: The task of identifying abstract concepts like "regenerative tourism" from text requires understanding context, semantics, and nuance. Classical machine learning techniques (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM with TF-IDF vectors) are inadequate because they treat words as independent features and fail to capture the complex relationships and meanings within a sentence. For example, the phrase "authentic village experience" has a completely different meaning than the individual words "authentic," "village," and "experience" in isolation.  
Why a Transformer is Ideal: A deep learning approach, specifically a transformer-based ANN, is essential. Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence, allowing them to build a rich, context-aware understanding of the text. This makes them exceptionally well-suited to this problem, far surpassing the capabilities of simpler ANNs like RNNs or LSTMs for classification tasks.
Question 3: Model Development and Evaluation (20 marks)
Model Development Process:
Baseline Model: A simple baseline model (e.g., Logistic Regression on TF-IDF features) will be established to provide a performance benchmark.
Initial Transformer Model: The pre-trained DistilBERT model will be fine-tuned with default hyperparameters.
Optimization: The model's performance will be systematically improved through rigorous hyperparameter tuning.
Optimization Techniques & Hyperparameter Tuning:
Optimizer: The AdamW optimizer will be used, as it is the standard for training transformer models.
Hyperparameter Tuning: A systematic search (e.g., grid search or random search) will be conducted on key hyperparameters, including:
Learning Rate: Testing values from 5e-5 to 1e-4.
Batch Size: Experimenting with sizes like 16, 32, and 64 to balance training speed and model stability.
Number of Epochs: Using early stopping on the validation set to prevent overfitting.
Evaluation Metrics: Performance will be evaluated using metrics appropriate for multi-label classification, including label-wise F1-score, Hamming Loss, and overall accuracy.
Question 4: Web Application Implementation (10 marks)
Implementation: A simple but functional web application will be developed using Streamlit or FastAPI with a basic HTML/CSS front-end.
User Interaction:
The user will be presented with a text area to input a tourist review.
Upon clicking a "Classify" button, the input text will be sent to the deployed ANN model via an API call.
The model's predictions—a probability score for each of the four experiential dimensions—will be returned and displayed to the user, likely as a bar chart for clear visualization.
Question 5: Explainable AI (XAI) (20 marks)
XAI Methodology: The project will implement a post-hoc explanation method to ensure transparency. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is the chosen methodology because it provides robust, game-theory-based explanations for the output of any machine learning model, including complex transformers.  
XAI Feature Implementation:
The web application will include an interactive "Show Explanation" feature for each prediction.
When activated, the SHAP library will be used to calculate the contribution of each word in the input review to the model's prediction for each specific dimension.
UI/UX Design: The explanation will be presented intuitively. The original review text will be displayed with words highlighted in varying shades of red (pushing the prediction higher) and blue (pushing the prediction lower), making it easy for a user to see exactly why the model classified a review as being related to "Immersive Culinary," for example.  
Question 6: GenAI (20 marks)
GenAI Implementation: The same multi-label classification task will be implemented using a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) like GPT-4 via its API.  
Prompt Engineering: A carefully designed prompt will be created. This will include a few-shot learning approach, where the prompt provides the LLM with 2-3 examples of reviews and their correct classifications before presenting the review to be analyzed. This helps guide the model to produce a structured, reliable output.
Comparative Analysis: A critical analysis will be performed comparing the two approaches:
Performance: Quantitative comparison of classification accuracy between the fine-tuned transformer and the LLM.
Pros & Cons:
Fine-tuned ANN: Pros include higher potential accuracy for a specific task, lower inference cost, and greater control. Cons include the need for a labeled dataset and development time.
GenAI (LLM): Pros include rapid prototyping and flexibility. Cons include higher API costs, potential for inconsistent or un-parseable outputs, and less direct control over the reasoning process.
Innovation Opportunities: The analysis will discuss how GenAI could be used in the broader "Aria" project for the narrative generation part of the itinerary, complementing the specialized classification task handled by the ANN.

NIB 7088 Artificial Neural Network Coursework Report
Project Title: An Explainable Neural Network for Classifying Experiential Dimensions in Sri Lankan Tourist Reviews.
Student: B M J N Balasuriya - COMScDS242P-009@student.nibm.lk

1. Problem Statement
The Sri Lankan tourism sector is at a strategic turning point, aiming to transition from a volume based model to a high value one. This shift is driven by the modern European traveler, who exhibits a "Value Paradox": while cost conscious, their primary motivation is the authenticity and transformative potential of an experience, not the lowest absolute price. These travelers seek journeys aligned with nuanced themes such as regenerative tourism, wellness, and culinary immersion preferences that traditional tourism platforms, with their generic categorical filters (e.g., "beach," "heritage site"), fail to address effectively.
This creates a significant information gap. The rich, descriptive content of tourist reviews contains valuable insights into these experiential qualities, but this data is unstructured and difficult to leverage at scale. To power a new generation of personalized travel recommendation systems, a mechanism is needed to quantify these abstract dimensions from raw text.
This project addresses this challenge by developing a specialized Artificial Neural Network designed as a multi label text classification system. The model's objective is to analyze English language tourist reviews and classify them according to four key experiential dimensions derived from modern traveler motivations:
Regenerative & Eco Tourism: Travel focused on positive social and environmental impact.
Integrated Wellness: Journeys combining physical and mental well-being.
Immersive Culinary: Experiences centered on authentic, local cuisine.
Off the Beaten Path Adventure: Exploration of less crowded natural landscapes.
By transforming qualitative user sentiment into a structured, quantitative format, this ANN will serve as the foundational "Experiential Engine" for the broader travel concept, enabling a more intelligent and nuanced approach to travel personalization. The primary dataset for this task is the "Tourism and Travel Reviews: Sri Lankan Destinations" corpus from Mendeley Data.

2. Model Architecture

The task of identifying abstract, context-dependent concepts like "regenerative tourism" from text necessitates a model that can comprehend semantic nuance, a capability that extends beyond traditional machine learning methods.

2.1. Project Scaffolding and Environment Setup
To ensure the project adheres to industry best practices for reproducibility, scalability, and maintainability, a standardized project structure was established using the cookiecutter-data-science template. 
Environment Manager (conda): Conda was chosen for its robust ability to manage not only Python packages but also complex non-Python dependencies, ensuring a consistent and reproducible environment across different machines.
Code Quality (ruff): The project utilizes Ruff, providing a single, unified solution for linting, formatting, and import sorting.
Testing Framework (pytest): Pytest was selected as the testing framework due to its simple, Pythonic syntax and powerful features like fixtures, which are ideal for setting up reusable test data and components in a data science context.
Documentation (mkdocs): MkDocs was integrated for generating a clean, searchable documentation website from simple Markdown files.
Version Control (Git & GitHub): The project is managed under Git version control. A public repository named explainable-tourism-nlp was created on GitHub to facilitate collaboration, showcase the development process, and serve as a public portfolio piece.
Licensing (MIT License): The project is licensed under the permissive MIT License. This was a strategic choice to ensure the code is fully open for evaluation by academic mentors and potential employers, while also granting the freedom to integrate this work into a future proprietary, commercial application without restriction.

2.1 Justification for an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Classical machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Naive Bayes using TF-IDF vectors, are fundamentally inadequate for this problem. These methods operate on a "bag-of-words" principle, treating text as a collection of independent keywords and failing to capture the crucial role of word order, context, and semantic relationships. For instance, a classical model would struggle to differentiate between "a peaceful retreat" and "a retreat from peace," as it lacks a true understanding of the sentence's structure. An ANN, particularly a deep learning model designed for sequential data, is required to build a richer, more context aware representation of the text.

2.2 Transformer Based Architecture

The chosen architecture is a fine-tuned transformer model, which represents the state-of-the-art for NLP tasks. Unlike simpler ANNs like RNNs or LSTMs, transformers use a self-attention mechanism. This allows the model to weigh the importance of every word in a sentence relative to every other word, enabling it to capture the long range dependencies and global semantic context necessary to identify complex, abstract themes.
The specific implementation will be as follows:
Base Model: A pre-trained transformer such as DistilBERT will be used as the starting point. DistilBERT offers a strong balance of high performance and computational efficiency, making it ideal for a project with a defined timeline.
Classification Head: The pre-trained transformer base will be augmented with a classification head consisting of:
A dropout layer for regularization to prevent overfitting.
A final dense (fully connected) layer with four output neurons, one for each of the experiential dimensions.
Activation Function: The final layer will use a Sigmoid activation function. Unlike Softmax, which is suited for single-label classification, Sigmoid outputs an independent probability (between 0 and 1) for each label. This is essential for a multi-label task where a single review can be associated with multiple dimensions simultaneously.

3. Model Development

The model development process followed a structured pipeline, from data preparation to training and evaluation, leveraging the Hugging Face ecosystem for efficiency and reproducibility.

3.1 Data Preparation & Preprocessing

Dataset: The "Tourism and Travel Reviews: Sri Lankan Destinations" dataset from Mendeley Data was used.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): An initial EDA was conducted to understand the dataset's characteristics. This included analyzing the distribution of review lengths and star ratings, and using word clouds and n-gram analysis to identify frequently occurring terms and phrases.
Labeling: A semi-supervised labeling strategy was employed. A lexicon of keywords and phrases relevant to each of the four dimensions was created to programmatically assign initial labels. A subset of these labels was then manually verified to create a high-quality ground truth for training.
Preprocessing & Tokenization: The raw text was cleaned by converting it to lowercase and removing punctuation and special characters. A model-specific AutoTokenizer was used to convert the text into numerical token IDs, with padding and truncation applied to ensure uniform sequence length within each batch.
Dataset Splitting: The dataset was divided into training (70%), validation (15%), and testing (15%) sets to ensure robust model evaluation.

3.2 Training

The model was trained using the high level Trainer API from the Hugging Face transformers library, which automates the training loop. The loss function used was
BinaryCrossEntropyWithLogitsLoss, which is the standard and most appropriate choice for multi-label classification problems where each label is treated as an independent binary task.

4. Optimization Techniques Employed

To ensure the model achieved the highest possible performance, a systematic optimization process was undertaken, beginning with a performance baseline and followed by rigorous hyperparameter tuning.

4.1 Baseline Model

To establish a performance benchmark, a baseline model was first developed using a classical machine learning approach: Logistic Regression with TF-IDF features. This allowed for a clear comparison to quantify the performance gains achieved by the more complex transformer architecture.

4.2 Optimizer Selection

The AdamW optimizer was used for training the transformer model. This optimizer is a variant of Adam that incorporates weight decay and is the standard and recommended choice for training transformer-based models, known for its stability and effective convergence.

4.3 Hyperparameter Tuning

A systematic search was conducted to find the optimal hyperparameters for the fine-tuning process. The key hyperparameters tuned were:
Learning Rate: Various learning rates were tested within the typical range for fine-tuning transformers (e.g., 1e-4 to 5e-5) to find the optimal rate that balances convergence speed and stability.
Batch Size: Different batch sizes (e.g., 16, 32, 64) were experimented with. Larger batch sizes can speed up training but require more memory, while smaller sizes can offer better generalization.
Number of Epochs: The model was trained for several epochs, with early stopping implemented. This technique monitors the performance on the validation set at the end of each epoch and halts the training process if the validation loss stops improving, thereby preventing overfitting.

5. Evaluation Results

The model's performance was assessed using metrics specifically suited for multi-label classification tasks, as standard accuracy can be misleading when an instance can have multiple correct labels.

5.1 Evaluation Metrics

Label-wise F1-Score: This metric calculates the F1-score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) for each label independently and then averages them. It provides a balanced measure of a model's performance across all categories, especially in cases of class imbalance.
Hamming Loss: This metric measures the fraction of labels that are incorrectly predicted. It is a straightforward measure of the error rate in a multi-label context, where a lower value indicates better performance.

5.2 Performance Comparison

(This section is a placeholder for your final results.)
A detailed comparison of the performance of the baseline model and the final, optimized Core ANN will be presented here. The results will be displayed in a table format to clearly illustrate the performance uplift achieved with the fine-tuned transformer model.

6. Experimentation Conducted

The development of the final model involved a series of structured experiments designed to validate architectural choices and optimize performance.
Architectural Comparison: The primary experiment was the head-to-head comparison between the classical machine learning baseline (Logistic Regression) and the deep learning approach (fine-tuned transformer). This was conducted to empirically validate the hypothesis that an ANN is necessary to capture the semantic complexity of the task.
Hyperparameter Optimization Experiments: The hyperparameter tuning process was conducted as a series of controlled experiments. Each run, with a different combination of learning rate and batch size, was logged and evaluated against the validation set to systematically identify the configuration that yielded the best performance.
Future Experimentation: While the current model achieves strong performance, further experiments could explore more advanced techniques. This includes testing different pre-trained backbones (e.g., RoBERTa for potentially higher accuracy) or implementing more sophisticated loss functions, such as those based on contrastive learning, which are designed to better model the relationships between labels. These avenues represent promising directions for future work to further enhance the model's capabilities.

Of course. For cleaning and preprocessing text data like tourism reviews, you need a combination of a strong theoretical foundation and practical, adaptable code. Here are my top recommendations.

Literature Review Recommendation 📚
For a comprehensive academic overview, I highly recommend the survey paper:

"Text Preprocessing for Text Mining and Natural Language Processing: A Survey" by U. S. Jivani.

This paper provides an excellent, structured review of the different stages of text preprocessing, from tokenization to feature extraction. It critically evaluates various techniques and their impact on the performance of downstream NLP tasks like sentiment analysis. It's the perfect starting point to understand the "why" behind each cleaning step and to be able to justify your methodological choices in your MSc thesis.

Practical Code Guide & Tutorial 💻
For the implementation, one of the best resources to follow is the article:

"A Guide to Cleaning Text for NLP in Python" on the Towards Data Science blog.

This is a fantastic, hands-on guide that provides clear Python code examples for each essential preprocessing step. It's highly practical and directly applicable to your sri_lanka_reviews.csv dataset.

Here’s a summary of the key steps it covers, which you should adapt for your project:

Lowercasing: Convert all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.

Punctuation Removal: Eliminate punctuation marks that don't carry significant meaning for sentiment analysis.

Stopword Removal: Remove common words (like "the", "a", "is") that add little value. You'll use libraries like NLTK or spaCy for this.

Frequent/Rare Word Removal: Analyze word frequencies in your corpus and consider removing the most and least common words, as they can sometimes be noise.

Spelling Correction: Use libraries like textblob to correct common misspellings, which are very frequent in user reviews.

Tokenization: Break down sentences into individual words or "tokens."

Lemmatization: This is a crucial step. It reduces words to their root form (e.g., "running" becomes "run"). This helps to consolidate different forms of a word into a single feature. You'll use NLTK's WordNetLemmatizer or spaCy's built-in lemmatizer for this.
